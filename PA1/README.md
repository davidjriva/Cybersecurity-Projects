Programming Assignment 1 -- Block & Stream Ciphers

Notes for TA:
    A Makefile is provided in this submission for your convenience. The Makefile generates a binary named "cipher" with the command "make", and you can run it using a command like "./cipher B inputFile.txt outputFile.txt key.txt E" for testing different files or modes of operation.

    Additionally, I've included configurable variables at the top of the Makefile for various files. While you may use a grading script, these variables allow for easy customization if needed.

Assignment: 
    Requirements:
        - Include a Makefile for compilation
        - The binary executable generated by the makefile should be named "cipher"
        - The program should take five command-line args in the specified order:
            1. The first arg: 'B' for block cipher or 'S' for stream cipher
            2. The second arg: Input file name
            3. The third arg: Output file name
            4. The fourth arg: Keyfile (containing the symmetric key in ASCII format)
            5. The fifth arg: Mode of operation ('E' for encryption or 'D' for decryption)
            ** Terminate with appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
            ** The keyfile should not contain a newline character
        - For block encryption, the key size is fixed at 128-bits(16 bytes)
        - For stream encryption, the key can be of any length
        - Padding for block mode should be done using the byte value 0x81
        - The output file should be organized in 128-bit blocks for block mode and 8-bit multiples for stream mode

    Description of Algorithms:
        Block Cipher
            1. Pad (if required) --> Encrypt (XOR with key) --> swap bytes
            2. Block size is 128 bits
            3. XOR key with data block bitwise
            4. Swap bytes based on a specific algorithm involving the key
            5. Decryption is the reverse process

        Stream Cipher
            1. XOR input stream with key
            2. Bitwise XOR of input bits with corresponding key bits
            3. Reuse the key from the beginning if it is exhausted
            4. Same module for encryption and decryption

    What to Turn In:
        1. Makefile
        2. C/C++ programs
        3. README file containing instructions for executing the program
        4. Test your program on CS machines where the TA will grade it
